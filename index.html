        <p>I am a native North Carolinian, born and raised in Charlotte. After high school, I pursued my lifelong dream
           of becoming an actor and was priveledged to attend The Atlantic Theater Company Acting Conservatory in New York City.
           After several years appearing in small film and television roles, I decided to return to school and pursue
           a graudate degree in Social Work.
        </p>

        <p> As a versatile substance abuse clinician skilled in assessments, intakes, group/individual/family therapy, referrals, crisis management and
            case management, I have extensive knowledge of utilization review/pre-authorization processes in a
            leadership role as well as comprehensive knowledge of DSM-V, ICD-10 and medical/pharmacological
            terminology. I have worked in the detox, residential inpatient and outpatient levels of care.</p>

        <p> As the opioid epidemic rages on, the need for comprehensive treatment and effective modalities
            that deliver effective solutions to those affected by this crisis are becoming more and more imperative.
            Sensing that technology can and will assist in the delivery of these outcomes, I have decided to combine
            my clinical skills with the tools offered by this technology to streamline the process of offering
            holistic healing to a desperate populaion yearning for answers.
