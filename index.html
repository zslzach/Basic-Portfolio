        <p>Following a 1945 nuclear test in White Sands, New Mexico, the image of BOB was seemingly regurgitated 
            from a white figure.[5] BOB spent several years with Mike, feeding off of fear and pain until Mike 
            "saw the face of God" and cut off his own arm. BOB then lurked around the Great Northern Hotel for 40 
            years.[6]When Leland Palmer was a boy, Robertson lived in a white house near his grandfather's summer 
            house at Pearl Lakes. He taunted Leland, asking "do you wanna play with fire, little boy?"[1] BOB told 
            Leland that he wanted to play, and then "opened" Leland and went inside him.[7]</p>
